    <h2>
      The Lobbyist.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If a persistent intermeddler without proper warrant in Government affairs,
      an unscrupulous dealer in threats and promises amongst public men, a
      constant menace to sworn servants of the people in their offices of trust,
      a tempter of the corrupt and a terror to the timid who are delegated to
      power a remorseless enemy to wholesome legislation, a constant friend to
      conspirators against the common welfare for private gain&mdash;if such a
      compound of dangerous and insolent qualities merged in one personality,
      active, vigilant, unblushing, be a Lobbyist&mdash;then Collis P.
      Huntington is a Lobbyist at the doors of Congress, in its corridors and in
      its councils, at Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is the spirit incarnate of Monopoly in its most aggressive form. Among
      the intrenched powers which have sapped the vitality and are a menace to
      the existence of our form of republican government, he is strong with
      their strength, dangerous with their power, perilous with the insolence of
      their courtesies, the blandishment of their open or covert threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly thirty years he has engendered broadcast political corruption
      in order to enrich himself and his associate railroad magnates at the
      public cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The declared representative now of those who have been thus far successful
      conspirators against the general Treasury and ruthless oppressors of every
      vital interest of defenceless California, with resonant voice and open
      hand he is clearly visible upon parade, demanding attention from the
      elected servants of all the people, and easily dwarfing the lessor lobby
      by the splendor of his equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English Parliament would relegate such an intruder to the street; the
      French Deputies point to his credentials with infinite scorn; Italian
      statesmen would shrink from a perusal of his record, and the Spanish
      Cortes decline to listen to any plea that men who are at one and the same
      time known robbers and declared beggars have blended and vested rights as
      both such to millions of public money.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the vision of thoughtful rulers and myriads of patriots throughout the
      world, reading history now as it is being created from day to day, the
      Anarchist naturally looms in the background of such a spectacle.

      A Search-Light.

    <p>
      In order that a proper side-light be flashed upon him; that his choice
      methods of dealing with men and accomplishing his purposes may pass in
      review; that some Californians and many national legislators may be
      informed of that which they never knew, or reminded of that which they may
      have forgotten; that the record of his accidental and forced confession in
      open Court of an appalling use of money in defending stolen millions and
      grasping after more shall be revived; that his low estimate of the honor
      and integrity of public men, and his essential contempt for the masses,
      may be contrasted with his high appreciation of the debauching power of
      money; that the enslavement by himself and his associates of the naturally
      great State of California and her indignant people may be once more
      proclaimed with bitter protest and earnest appeal to all the citizens of
      our sister States throughout our vast commonwealth; and to the end that no
      such palpable embodiment of political infamy may continue to stalk without
      rebuke through all the open ways and sacred recesses of popular power
      crystallized at Washington&mdash;I propose to revive the recollection of&mdash;and
      to briefly comment on&mdash;the whilom notorious Huntington-Colton Letters
      which became public property as part of the records of the Superior Court
      of Sonoma County in this State.

    <h2>
      Huntington-Colton Letters.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of an apparent nearly 600, only about 200 are in evidence. It is to be
      regretted that more did not come to light. If the public could only be
      privileged to read what he wrote to Leland Stanford, and to Charles
      Crocker, and to Mark Hopkins&mdash;as well as to David D. Colton&mdash;there
      there would be much to reflect upon. But the public never will see such
      letters. The nature of them required their immediate destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Huntington explains:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am often asked by my associates in California about my views in matters
      that I have written to the others of, and allow me to say that all letters
      that I number consecutively, I have supposed would be read by all, and
      then go into the basket together." (No. 561. N. Y., April 7th, 1875.)
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the safest way. It is not wise to allow great numbers of thinking
      people to read that they are victims of chicanery, corruption in high
      places, bribery, hire and salary, and oppression through conspiracy. There
      might be something more than a spice of danger in much carelessness.

    <h2>
      Tone of the Letters
    </h2>
    <p>
      The letters under consideration, written during the four years from
      October, 1874, to October, 1878, tell a plain enough, tale of their own.
      They abound with cool and easy allusions to various men and things: to
      "convincing" public servants; to "fixing" committees in Congress; to
      "persuading" the most exalted officials; purchasing National legislators,
      as well as Territorial Governors; to deceiving local communities, and the
      United States generally, with well considered cunning; to working noisily
      with blatant instruments and quietly through masked agents; to creating
      public opinion by means of false showings; to electing or defeating
      candidates for office; to smiting enemies and rewarding friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed as a contribution to the literature of fatal political infection
      the letters are unique. They embody an epitome of just such work as their
      writer is prepared to now continue, if the temper of the American people
      will permit him to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plane upon which his exertions will possibly be made may be justly
      imagined from the intimate knowledge and implied approval of bribery on a
      collossal scale which he mentions frankly and carelessly thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I returned from Washington last night. The sub-committee of the R. R.
      Committee of the House have agreed to report Scott T. and P. Bills through
      to San Diego, and I am disposed to think the full committee will report it
      to the House. It can be hoped, but I doubt if it would be worth the cost,
      as I do not think it can pass the House. Scott, no doubt, will promise all
      the&mdash;say $40,000,000 that the Act would give him." (No, 428. N. Y.,
      Feb. 23, 1878.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The T. and P. folks are working hard on their bill. * * * They offered
      one M. C. one thousand dollars cash down, five thousand when the Bill
      passed and ten thousand of the bonds when they got them, if he would vote
      for the Bill." (No. 455. N. Y., May 3, 1878.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought naturally occurs here: If such matter-of-course mention of
      appalling debauch cry of political honor and morality reflects the
      character of a conscience and foreshadows the scope of a purpose,&mdash;if
      such were his estimate of Congress, and such his belief then&mdash;how
      much are the Central Pacific magnates disposed to promise now to soon
      evade and eventually escape payment of, say, $67,000,000 now nearly due to
      the Government?

    <h2>
      "The People Can Never Have an Open Highway."
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1874, Thomas A. Scott, of Pennsylvania, proposed to build the Texas and
      Pacific Railway, and to secure subsidies for that purpose from the
      Southern States, as well as from Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      [With the question of subsidies in the abstract, this writing has nothing
      to do.]
    </p>
    <p>
      If he succeeded, the Southern Pacific would lose its early clutch on the
      throat of our commerce, an hundred thousand voters would escape from
      political bondage&mdash;its paralyzing grip would be weakened, if not
      broken. There was deadly issue at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scott wrote to Huntington Dec. 9, 1874:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We expect to build our road to San Diego, as already pledged to the
      public to do so." (No. 416. N. Y., Dec. 10, 1874.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, Huntington wrote to Colton:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scott is doing all he can to push his Texas Pacific Road, and his
      strength all lies in one thing: The Southern Pacific of California is
      controlled by the Central Pacific and Union Pacific, and will be used only
      to help those great monopolies, and if we are beat by Scott, it will be
      because our friends have persisted in helping him to convince the public
      the above is true, and the people can never have an open highway so long
      as the Central Pacific controls all the roads that reach out to the
      Pacific." (No. 267. N. Y., April 3, 1877.)

    <h2>
      Behind the Scenes.
    </h2>
    <p>
      These Colton letters emphasize Huntington's opinions, and expose his
      methods during the struggle. Not completely, of course. One must read
      between the lines occasionally. Something is left to surmise&mdash;to the
      reflection, of Hamlet's Uncle, that
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the corrupted currents of this world offense's gilded hand may shove
      by Justice; and oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he speaks of Mr. Justice Field not sitting in a certain suit (No.
      475. N.Y., Sept. 30th, 1878), and, just how he "got the Secretary of War
      out of all ugly idea in about twenty minutes," saw three other Cabinet
      members shortly after, and caused a President to abandon being "cross" and
      to "laugh heartily" (No. 361. N. Y., Oct. 10th, 1877), is not precisely
      clear; nor are details given as to how the Railroad Committee was sure to
      be "convinced" (No, 59. N. Y., Nov. 30, 1879) or exactly what he did
      before writing: "I stayed in Washington two days to fix up R. R. Committee
      in Senate. * * * * The Committee is just as we want it." (No. 261. N. Y.,
      March 7th, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And it should be remembered, too, that the writer prided himself in
      confessing to deliberate wariness in bribery and, caution in corrupting,
      occupying in, "high ground" and preparing in advance to defy
      investigators. As, witness:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I returned from Washington this morning; shall go back next Monday night.
      * * * Scott is working mostly among the commercial men. He switched
      Senator Spencer of Alabama and Walker of Virginia this week, but you know
      they can be switched back with the proper arrangements when they are
      wanted; but Scott is asking for so much that he can promise largely to pay
      when he wins, and you know I keep on high ground." (No. 110. N.Y., Jan.
      29th, 1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I see you I shall have much to tell you of Washington matters that I
      have not time to write, but I keep on high ground so that we cannot be
      hurt by any investigation." (No. 138. N.Y., March 23d, 1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      No just inference can be drawn from such confidential utterances that the
      "high ground" of safety was fertile soil bearing the flowers and fruits of
      political purity, rather than a chosen rock of refuge from continuous
      danger; and the allusion to possible "investigation" involves the
      confession that it was deserved and the dread that it might occur.

      Use of Influence, and Power of Money.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But, there is no obscurity of meaning, nor is there much room for doubt,
      that there is the expression of mature judgment based upon wide experience
      and ample practice, in the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think this coming session of Congress will be composed of the hungriest
      set of men that ever got together." (No. 389. N.Y., Nov. 30th, 1874.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sent a man to Richmond, Va., on Saturday, and one to Albany to-day, to
      get resolutions passed by the legislatures against subsidies. I think it
      will control two members of the R. R. Committee." (No. 117. N. Y., Feb.
      14th, 1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left Washington on Friday, the 11th. I think our matters are safe there
      for the Session." (No. 218. N. Y., Aug. 4th, 1876).
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think our land matters in Washington have been fixed." (No. 366. N. Y.,
      Oct. 29th, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think the R. R. Committee is right," (as made up for the 45th
      Congress), "but the Com. on Territories I do not like. A different one was
      promised me." (No. 373. N. Y., Oct. 30th, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think we can get any legislation this session for extension of
      land grants unless we pay more for it than it is worth." (No. 378. N. Y.,
      Nov. 9th, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we are not hurt this session it will be because we pay much money to
      prevent it." (No. 381. N. Y., Nov. 15th, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Congress is nothing but an agrarian camp." (No. 449. N. Y., April
      19th, 1878).
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done all I can to prevent certain bills from being reached, and do
      not think any bills can be that will hurt us." (No. 468. N. Y., June 15th,
      1878.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have received several letters and telegrams from Washington to-day, all
      calling me there, as Scott will certainly pass his Texas Pacific bill if I
      do not come over; and I shall go over to-night. * * * It cost money to fix
      things so that I would know his bill would not pass. I believe that with
      $200,000 I can pass our bill." (No. 107. N. Y., Jan. 17, 1876.)

    <h2>
      A Low Estimate of Congressional Brains and Public Interest.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The alarm evidently felt and certainly shown that the Central Pacific and
      Southern Pacific were apt to be commonly considered and treated as being
      one concern, and not as distinct and separate things&mdash;incestuous and
      eager lovers instead of alien rivals and natural foes&mdash;conspirators
      rather than competitors&mdash;would be simply amusing were it less
      offensive and more in accordant vibration with the pulsations of common
      sense amongst a people not wholly fools. That it was thought possible to
      foster the idea and expand it into a belief, that Stanford, Huntington,
      the Crockers and Hopkins&mdash;Janus faced&mdash;looking northerly along
      monopoly lines, were the implacable enemies of the Crockers, Stanford,
      Hopkins and Huntington gazing along monopoly lines southerly; and that the
      interests of the government and the good of the people required the tender
      coddling of that nursling until it became strong enough to sit up and take
      nourishment in the shape of meaty millions of dollars, involves a
      sarcastic comment upon measured law makers and estimated victims. Yet the
      improbable becomes at times the possible and the actual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark the plaintive wailing in the letters:
    </p>
    <p>
      "On account of this legislation I think it important that the S. P. should
      be disconnected from the Central as much as it well can be." (No. 416. N.
      Y., Dec. 10, 1874.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Governor S. said some good things to the Chronicle interviewer; but I
      think it unfortunate that he should so closely connect the C. P. with the
      S. P., as that is the only weapon our enemies have to fight us with in
      Congress." (No. 590. N.Y., May 28, 1875.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it was known that the C. P. does not control the S. P., I think we
      could beat (Scott) all the time." (No. 157. N. Y., April 27, 1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stanford, Tom Scott and many others have been trying for so long to
      convince the country that the Central Pacific is building the S. P. that I
      am not able now to convince Congress that it is not true." (No. 24. N. Y.,
      Dec. 25, 1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have little or no fears of his (Scott) doing anything at the extra
      session, but if he can convince Congress that the S. P. is controlled by
      the C. P. * * * * I believe he can pass his bill to build on the direct
      line between Ft. Yuma and San Diego, and I think I know enough of
      Washington to know how he to can do it." (No. 268. N. Y., March 20, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "His (Scott) strength all lies in one thing: The S. P. of Cal. is
      controlled by the C. P. and U. P.; and will be used only to help those
      great monopolies." (No. 276. N. Y., April 3, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you say about our stopping at Ft. Yuma is well, and would be almost
      conclusive if the S. P. was not owned and controlled by the C. P.; but
      when we tell Congress we are willing to build this road, the answer is
      always the same: Of course you are to protect the Central, but what the
      country wants is a competing road." (No. 307. N. Y., May 17, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, he has nearly convinced the country that the C. P. is
      building the S. P. to prevent competition; and I find it very hard to It
      make them believe anything else." (No. 425. N. Y., Feb. 25, 1878.)

      Wrongs of California.
    </h2>
    <p>
      So much for the United States. Let us now glance at California, as mangled
      by the showing of the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it may as well be stated just here, that Leland Stanford and his
      associates, having first in mind and at heart the design to eventually
      defraud the United States Government of many millions of dollars, bent all
      their energies next to the maintaining of their ownership of California
      and her citizens, and all their property; and to keeping under control
      their rights, privileges, hopes, fears, ambitions and acts ever and ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A competing line&mdash;"an open highway"&mdash;across the continent would
      balk their purposes. The Union Pacific was dangerous in that respect.
      Therefore, it was to be given 10/22 of the Southern Pacific stock, and
      become a partner instead of a rival. Jay Gould was to participate in the
      spoils of our bondage. Concerning which the Letters say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will say here that I think well of this, as it will have our interest
      in the Central greater than in the Southern Pacific, which will satisfy
      the Union Pacific, which, in my opinion, is very important. Of course you
      will see the importance of the public not knowing anything of this
      arrangement." (No. 24. N. Y., December 25th, 1876.)

      Check to San Diego.
    </h2>
    <p>
      How neatly the San Diegans were induced to continue to tread out the old
      measures of railroad corn for their masters, whose private intentions were
      to lull them into silence with false hopes, fasten them in commercial
      vassalage, and denounce, as well as keep comparatively deserted, their
      splendid harbor, is quite clearly shown:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should infer from one of the newspaper clips that you sent that our San
      Diego friends were displeased about something." (No. 14. N. Y., Sept. 23,
      1875.)
    </p>
    <p>
      That was intended to be facetious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your interesting letter of the 5th you mention San Diego matters. Now
      it is well to switch that people from the Texas Pacific road, but I would
      suggest that you keep on asking them what they will do, but not make them
      any definite proposition, for if you do, it will be sent East at once, and
      I am working with the South and saying to them that our interest lays with
      them; and that what San Francisco and Cal. wants is a direct communication
      with New Orleans and other Gulf ports, and that our interest lays that
      way; and we oppose the Texas Pacific because we think if it is built it
      will prevent for many years our getting such a connection." (No. 37. N.
      Y., October 18, 1875.)
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not merrily written.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would much like a report of the harbor of San Diego, as I think it is,
      but I would not care to pay much money for it. Hyde is a bright man, and
      if he knows how worthless the harbor of San Diego is for an extensive deep
      sea commerce, I would like a report from him." (No. 335. N. Y., August 18,
      1877.)

    <h2>
      In California Politics.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dominating influence of the railroad monopolists in California
      politics has been California politicians. They are in the vein of the
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voters of California have for many years been the playthings of a few
      political bandits. They have been driven in the harness of their various
      parties to the polls by "bosses" shrewdly selected and liberally paid. The
      results may be seen in glittering heaps of spoils, concentrated in a few
      hands, in disheartening displays of vast wealth by arrogant possessors who
      are not properly the owners of it, and who are limited alike in number as
      in intelligent patriotism; may be felt in unwarranted tax taxation&mdash;may
      be heard in the derision of insolent laughter from lips merry with the
      delight of fancied security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creation of the "boss" rule simplified systematic bribery, concerning
      which read:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I received your telegram that Wm. B. Carr has had for his services
      $60,000 S. P. bonds; then asking how much more I think his services are
      worth for the future. * * * In view of the many things we have now before
      Congress * " * it is very important that his friends in Washington should
      be with us, and if that could be brought about by paying Carr say $10,000
      to $20,000 per year, I think we could afford to do it, but, of course, not
      until he had controlled his friends. I would like to have you get a
      written proposition from Carr, in which he would agree to control his
      friends for a fixed sum, then send it to me." (No. 99. N. Y., Jan. 14,
      1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for California.

    <h2>
      Cost of Arizona Legislature and Voters of New Mexico.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "If we had a franchise to build a road or two roads through Arizona (we
      controlling, but having it in the name of another party) it could be used
      against Scott. Cannot you have Stafford [Governor of Arizona] call the
      Legislature together and grant such charters as we want at a cost of say
      $25,000? If we could get such a charter as I spoke to you of it would be
      worth much money to us." (No. 18. N. Y., Sept. 27, 1875.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Stafford had better be in Washington at the commencement of the
      regular session to get Congress to confirm the Acts of Arizona." (No. 366,
      N. Y., Oct. 29, 1877.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As to New Mexico:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw Axtell, Gov. of New Mexico, and he said he thought that if we would
      send to him such a bill as we wanted to have passed into a law, he could
      get it passed with very little or no money; when, if we sent a man there,
      they would stick him for large amounts." (No. 366. N. Y., Oct. 29, 1877.)

    <h2>
      Corruption and Bribery.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Such in part, is the story of the Letters. If it is not one of appalling
      corruption and unhesitating bribery often repeated, what else is it? Why
      should it cost a specific $200,000 to pass any proper bill through
      Congress? $25,000 to convene a Territorial Legislature? $10,000 to $20,000
      a year to influence justly a few Californians? Influence thus exercised is
      as, palpable as it is direct.

    <h2>
      Nature and Value of Picnics.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But ends are sometimes attained by indirection. The Letters tell how. For
      example:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been working for the last two month to get a party, of say, 25
      Southern members of Congress to go out to California and over the line of
      the Southern Pacific and see what we have done and our ability to do. * *
      * I told Senator Gordon of Georgia if he could get up a party of the best
      men of the South we would pay all their expenses, which. I suppose would
      not be less than $10,000, and I think it would be money well expended."
      (No. 208. N. Y., July 26th, 1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But these Southern gentlemen seem to have been somewhat hesitating, as
      attest:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have telegraphed to-day to you to get some of the prominent men of San
      Francisco to telegraph to Gordon, Senator from Georgia, with other
      Southern men to go. While Gordon and some others are not afraid to go, G.
      tells me, that some of his friends do not like to go on an invitation from
      the R. R. Co." (No. 213. N. Y., Aug. 7th, 1876.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And the fear of a thoughtful constituency appears to have resulted in
      "some doubts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have had a lively time in getting so many good names signed and
      sent on in so short a time, inviting our Southern brethren to come to Cal.
      I saw Gordon and several others just before Congress adjourned, and they
      said they would go, but I have some doubts about it, as most of the
      members of Congress are looking after their re-election." (No. 221. N. Y.,
      Aug. 25th, 1875.)
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the above extracts may perhaps be interpreted the meaning
      of the news that has just come by telegraph that the "Senate Committee on
      Pacific Railroads will take a trip, soon after Congress adjourns, to San
      Francisco by way of the Union, Central and Southern Pacific systems&mdash;in
      Senator Brice's private car."

    <h2>
      Protest and Petition.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It would be an interesting, and to me a congenial task, to further analyze
      the Letters; to show what tools the monopolists secured, and how they
      worked with them; to set forth how rivalry was met and defeated; railroads&mdash;such
      as the Santa Monica&mdash;absorbed or paralyzed, and many things were done
      and undone. But my intention at the outset was simply to proclaim with
      irrefrageable proofs some shameful facts, and to protest against any
      faltering in enforcing they laws as they exist, compelling payment to the
      Government of great debts soon to mature. Of principal and interest there
      will be due from these monopolists and political corruptionists (the first
      payment, January 16, 1895; the last, January 1, 1899), $77,049,630.66&mdash;less
      some few millions now to their credit. The money can be collected, and it
      ought to be. In the meantime, the toleration of a lobby confessedly
      corrupt argues the existence of a Congress at best incompetent.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
